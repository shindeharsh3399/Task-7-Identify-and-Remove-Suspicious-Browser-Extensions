## 🔍 7. Researched Extension Risks

I researched how malicious browser extensions can negatively impact users. Here are key risks identified:

- **🔐 Data Theft**: Some extensions can log keystrokes or steal saved passwords and form data.
- **📡 User Tracking**: Many extensions track your browsing history and sell the data to third parties.
- **❌ Ad Injection**: They may insert pop-up ads, banners, or fake download buttons on websites.
- **🎯 Browser Hijacking**: Malicious add-ons can change your homepage or redirect your search engine.
- **🐢 Performance Issues**: Some consume CPU/RAM, slowing down your browser or crashing tabs.
- **🧱 Security Bypass**: Advanced ones can evade browser security or install additional malware.
